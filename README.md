**How to Bold / Italic and Create Links:**

With the `Pygroupbot v1.2.2` we initialized `parse_mode` to bot. Telegram bots has two parse_mode. First one is `Markdown`. In this parse mode you can bold text using '**' symbol and italic text using '__' like in the bellow example:

```python
pygroupbot.bot.token("<TOKEN>", mode= "Markdown")

paygroupbot.start_message("*Hello Dear!* _I am the PyGroupBot_")
```

We suggest to you use `html` as parse_mode. You can bold text with '<b></b>', italic text with '<i></i>' and create links with 'a' tag using in html like in the bellow example:

```python
pygroupbot.bot.token("<TOKEN>", mode= "html")

paygroupbot.start_message("<b>Hello Dear!</b>   <i>I am the PyGroupBot</i>   <a href='https://github.com/ranujasanmir/pygroupbot'>Go to github</a>")
```

### Errors

You will face some errors while using pygroupbot.

1. **Something Wrong. ERROR_523** - Something messing in the bot. Check bot admin rights..

2. **Bad request from telegram api. [Cannot run bot. check your internet connection]. ERROR_400** - This error saying bot has problem with connecting to the telegram api. Check your device internet connection. Or create new bot token from Bot Father and give it to the bot.

```python
pygroupbot.bot.token("<NEW_BOT_TOKEN>")
```

3. **Python version error. PyGroupBot bot need python3** - If you see this error you have to update your python version. pygroupbot can't run on python 2. It's very old version. All potato pc's can run python 3.2. So why are you using python2?

4. **.run() only need boolean value!** - It's mean you entered wrong value to run() function. run() only need True or False values.

```python
pygroupbot.run(True)
```

5. **pygroupbot token must not be a null** - This saying you didn't entered token.

6. **pygroupbot mode must not be a null** - To fix this error pass the parse_mode.

7. **PyGroupBot Server Not Started Yet - Bot is Offline...** - If bot didn't running this error will be show. Make sure to make pygroupbot.run(True). If you entered False, bot will not run.
